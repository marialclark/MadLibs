# MadLibs App

## Overview
MadLibs App is a simple React-based application that allows users to generate fun, randomized stories by filling out a form with different word inputs. The app dynamically updates to display a generated story based on user input and allows for easy resets to create new stories.

## Installation & Setup
### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd madlibs-app
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```
### 3. Run the App
```sh
npm run dev
```
This starts the **Vite development server** and runs the app in the browser.

## Tech Stack
- **React 18** (Frontend framework)
- **Vite** (Development server & bundler)
- **ESLint** (Code linting)
- **CSS Modules** (Styling)

## How It Works
1. The user fills out a form with different word inputs.
2. Upon submission, a **randomized MadLib story** is generated using their words.
3. The user can click "Restart" to generate a new story with different inputs.

## Future Enhancements
- Add multiple story templates for variety.
- Implement animations and improved UI styling.
- Allow users to save and share their generated stories.
